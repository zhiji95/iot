Brief introduction for each lab:
1. Lab1: 

        1. Micropython program to control the blink of the leds.
2. Lab2:   

       1.  Change the brightness of an LED and the pitch of a piezo in accordance to readings from the light sensor
        2. Debounce a button press.
        3. Create the combined system; the system is activated when the button is pressed and deactivated when released
3. Lab3:

        1. Display the time on the OLED display; the time should update like a regular watch. Be able to change time through the OLED display buttons.
        2. Adjust screen brightness based on ambient light.
        3. Add alarm functionality; Be able to set alarm through OLED display and when alarm goes off, a visual and audio notification
        should go off.
        4. Combine 1, 2, and 3.
        5. Text scrolling based on accelerometer readings.
4. Lab4:

        1. Interface with the Google Geolocation API and display your coordinates on the OLED display.
        2. Feed your coordinates into the OpenWeatherMap API to receive information about the weather in your area; display the results on your OLED display.
        3. Create a system to send tweets using the ESP8266.
5. Lab5:

        1. Create smartphone application that interfaces with the Google Speech API and sends translated commands to the smartwatch. Display the translated command on the smartphone application.
        2. Configure the smartwatch to be a server and be able to connect to it via a smartphone application, web browser, etc.
        3. Connect the smartphone application with the smartwatch; the commands to turn off/on the display, display the time, and display any
        other spoken message on the OLED display should be included.
6. Lab6:

Part One: Databases and Gesture Recognition

        1. Establish a connection between the smartwatch and the AWS server and continuously send accelerometer data to the AWS database at a frequency of at least 1 Hz.
        2. Setup a neural network on the AWS server that can recognize any letter in the word “COLUMBIA”.
        3. Obtain the word “COLUMBIA” within 10 tries and display the word one letter at a time on OLED.
Part Two: Creating the Smartwatch

        1. Features outlined for each of the subsystems should be functioning discretely.
                a. Voice Commands
                b. Smartphone Application
                c. Embedded Server/ESP8266 d. Cloud Server/Database
        2. All discrete components are combined and fully functioning.
